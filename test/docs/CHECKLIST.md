# DOT Documentation Examples Test Checklist

## Summary
- 40 .dot files (34 extracted from full workflows + 6 assembled from snippets)

## Issues Found During Validation (fixed in test DOTs)

1. **Several "full" digraphs in docs lack start/exit nodes** — 10 extracted DOTs were minimal digraph wrappers showing graph-level attributes without start/exit nodes or wiring. Fixed by adding them in test DOTs.

2. **All-conditional edges need unconditional fallback** — Validator requires at least one fallback edge when a node has only conditional outgoing edges. Fixed by adding fallback edges in assembled DOTs.

## Commands

```bash
# Run each phase:
./test/docs/run_tests.sh validate
./test/docs/run_tests.sh dry-run
./test/docs/run_tests.sh haiku
./test/docs/run_tests.sh full
```
